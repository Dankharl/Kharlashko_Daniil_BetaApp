//This file will contain the AppState class that handles the global login state.

// Notes:
//Great question! In SwiftUI, you use @EnvironmentObject to share data (in this case, AppState) across multiple views without needing to pass it down manually through each view

//1. Purpose of AppState Instance
//The AppState class manages the global state of your app, specifically whether the user is logged in or not. You need a single, shared instance of this class that all views can access to check the login status or trigger login/logout actions.

//2. Why Use .environmentObject(appState)?
//The .environmentObject() modifier is what allows you to inject AppState into the view hierarchy so that any child views can access it. When you provide AppState to a root view, all child views can reference it using @EnvironmentObject without having to pass it down manually through each view.

//In the AppState, we can hold the User object to store and manage user data globally acr\oss the app.
